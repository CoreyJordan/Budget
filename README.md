  After being frustrated with the abundance of low level free budgeting<br> 
  apps that don't quite perform to my needs, as well the paid apps that<br> 
  seem overpriced for the funtionality they offer, I have decided to<br> 
  attempt creating my own.

  It will be initially coded in SQL and C# with a winform UI.
